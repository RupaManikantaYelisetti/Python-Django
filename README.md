# Python-Django
# Python
      Python is a powerful programming language.It is possible to create programs with minimal amount of 
      code.
            example:print("Hello World")
# Advantages 
        * It is free and Open source code 
        * It is easy to read,learn and write 
        * It excutes the code line by line 
        * It is used for software development & web development.
# Dis Advantages
        * The line by line excution of code leads to slow execution.
        * It is weak in mobile computing.
        * It consumes more memory than some other languages like Java...
# Applications of Python 
        * Artificial Intelligence 
        * Machine Learning 
        * Backend Development

# Django 
        Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.

# Advantages 
        * It is an open-source framework for backend web applications.
        * It is scalable and fast processing.
# Dis Advantages 
        * It is too vast at times for the code.
        * It doesn't needs simple deployment,It takes a lot of time.
# How does Django works 
        * It follows MVT pattern 
            M stands for Model.The data what you want to present, usually data from database.
            V stands for views.A request that returns the template and content - based on the request from the user.
            T stands for Templates. An HTML file containing the layout of the webpage with logic and how to display the data.

# Model 
        The Model provides data from the database
            * In Django, the data is delivered as an object relational mapping, Which is a technique designed to make easier to work with databases.
            * The Models are usually located in a file called models.py.
# views 
        * A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
        * The Views are usually located in a file called Views.py.
# Templates 
        * A text file containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
        
        
# Connection between Python And Django 
       * Django is a restframework for python.It is a open source web development written in python.It is used for backend Applications.In Django we write API's for the applications.
